<h2 style="text-align: center;">About Me</h2>
<p> I was born in Austin, Texas, and am now a student in the McCombs School of Business at the University of Texas at Austin. I have lived in Austin for all 19 years of my life. I grew up going to every UT football game, dreaming of the day I could call UT my home just like both of my parents had. I went to a private high school in central Austin called Regents, and I finished 4/80. Being studious in high school allowed me to fulfill my dream of becoming a UT student. My passions are basketball, sneakers, listening to rap music, and fishing. Each of these things mean something different to me. Basketball is both something that I can do as an activity, and something that I can study as an analyst. Sneakers are something that I use as a way to express myself, as well as a way to increase my analytical capabilities in a lucrative way. Rap music gets my blood pumping, preparing me for anything. It gives me confidence and energy, which are very important to me on a daily basis. Fishing is something that allows me to spend time with family, particularly my dad, doing something that we both love.</p>
